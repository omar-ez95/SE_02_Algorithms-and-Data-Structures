# A* Algorithm and 8 Queens Problem Visualization
- This repo contains the code for visualizing the A* algorithm and 8 queens problem using Tkinter.
- It is made for an assigment at the CODE University of Applied Sciences.
- in each folder you will find a README.md file that explains the algorithm.

## Resources for the A* Algorithm and 8 Queens Problem
1. The code has been written with a lot of help from chatGPT and also Github Copilot.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure that Python (version 3 or above) is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Tkinter**: Tkinter should be included with Python standard libraries. If for some reason itâ€™s not included, you can install it using the package manager for your system:

  For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), use the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```
  For Red Hat-based systems (like Fedora), use the following command:
   ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
  ```
## Running the Code

- Run the following command to run the A* algorithm visualization:
  ```bash
    python3 astar/astar_visualization.py
    ```
- Run the following command to run the 8 queens problem visualization
  ```bash
    python3 8_queens/8_queens_playground.py
  ```
## Usage of A* algorithm visualization

- Click on a cell to set the start point (green).
- Click on another cell to set the end point (red).
- Click on other cells to create barriers (black).
- Click the "Start" button to run the A* algorithm and visualize the path (yellow).# SE_02_Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
